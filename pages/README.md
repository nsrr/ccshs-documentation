# About the Study

TheÂ Cleveland Children's Sleep and Health Study (CCSHS) is one of the largest population-based pediatric cohorts studied with objective sleep studies, and probably one with the largest minority representation. The cohort includes 907 children, studied at ages 8-11 years with in-home sleep studies, acoustic reflectometry, anthropometry, spirometry, BP, and NP and behavioral assessments. The cohort is a stratified random sample of full-term (FT) and PT children, born between 1988-1993, identified from the birth records of 3 Cleveland area hospitals.

CCSHS had multiple follow-up visits. The most recent visit, TREC, took place between 2006 and 2010. Data from the TREC visit are being posted first because this visit included full, in-lab polysomnography.
